# Privacy Policy for TopHat Question Notifier Extension

Last updated: 09/25/2024

This privacy policy explains what data is collected by the TopHat Question Notifier extension, how that data is used, and under what circumstances it may be shared. By using the TopHat Question Notifier extension, you agree to the terms outlined below.

## Data Collection

The TopHat Question Notifier extension is designed to send notifications when a new poll or question becomes live on the TopHat platform, specifically within the ‘Classroom’ tab.

The extension collects the following types of data:

	•	Website Content: The extension monitors the structure of the TopHat ‘Classroom’ tab to detect when a new poll or question is posted. This is done locally on the user’s device and no content, including text, images, videos, or hyperlinks, is transmitted or stored by the extension.
	•	Browser Information: The extension uses browser permissions to monitor whether the user has a TopHat ‘Classroom’ tab open. However, no browsing history or other website data outside of TopHat is collected, stored, or transmitted.
	•	Notifications Data: When a poll or question goes live, the extension triggers a notification through the browser’s notification system. No data related to the notification is stored or transmitted.

## Data Usage

The data collected by the extension is used solely for the following purposes:

	•	To detect live polls or questions on TopHat: The extension observes changes on the TopHat ‘Classroom’ tab to notify users when a new question is posted.
	•	To send notifications: The extension uses collected data to trigger desktop notifications, ensuring that users do not miss out on interactive class activities.

The TopHat Question Notifier extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data, such as name, email address, or other identifiers. The extension’s purpose is limited to monitoring TopHat pages for live questions and providing real-time notifications.

## Data Sharing

The TopHat Question Notifier extension does not share any data with third parties. Since no personal or identifiable information is collected or stored, there is no data to share with any external services, companies, or individuals.

We do not use any third-party services for tracking, analytics, or advertisement purposes.

## Required Permissions

To function properly, the TopHat Question Notifier extension requires the following permissions:

	•	Notifications: To display real-time notifications when a new question or poll is live in your TopHat class.
	•	Tabs: To check if you have the TopHat ‘Classroom’ tab open so the extension can monitor that page.
	•	Access to TopHat Website: The extension interacts only with the TopHat website to detect when a question or poll goes live.

These permissions are necessary for the extension's core functionality and are used strictly for sending notifications related to TopHat class activities.

## Data Security

As the TopHat Question Notifier extension does not store or transmit personal data, there are minimal security risks. However, the extension ensures that any data processing (such as detecting changes on the TopHat page) happens locally on your device. No data is sent to remote servers or external databases.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a new “Last updated” date. If any significant changes are made, we will notify users either through the extension or via another appropriate method.
